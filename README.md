RAMPA is an *end-to-end* AR-based PfD framework to enable the demonstration of robotic trajectories, training, and testing ML model augmented by real-time hand mimicry, visualization of the robot's motion, and trajectory adjustment in situ. By integrating in-situ simulation, real-time spatial understanding, and direct manipulation capabilities, RAMPA enhances the physical safety, flexibility of robotic operations, and efficiency of Programming from Demonstration (PfD) procedures, hence, the effectiveness and accessibility of human-robot collaboration. To assess the competence and performance of the RAMPA and compare it with kinesthetic control, manually moving the robot for demonstration, we conducted a comprehensive evaluation consisting of an experiment with three robotic tasks, 20 participants including both experienced and novice users, an extensive analysis using quantitative metrics such as task completion time and standard surveys concerning the usability, user experience, and task load. This work has been submitted to the *IEEE RA-L* for publication on **October 12, 2024** and published on February 26, 2025.

## How to use RAMPA

### Drawing a trajectory
To start drawing a trajectory, click the "record trajectory" button on the main menu. The application will wait for you to pinch your right hand to draw a trajectory. If you select the "follow real-time" toggle in the main menu, the simulated robot will follow your hand as you draw the trajectory. Otherwise, it will simulate the entire trajectory after you finish drawing. From the orientation dropdown in the main menu, you can select whether you want to fix an orientation or record the orientation of your hand while drawing the trajectory. You can save the trajectory you've drawn by clicking the "add to training set".

</p>

#### Inspecting the trajectory
Use the backward, forward, and play buttons provided in the trajectory capture menu to inspect the trajectory you've drawn. Clicking "redraw from current waypoint" will erase the trajectory after the current waypoint, and the application will expect you to draw the rest of the trajectory.

</p>

#### Auto-calibration
Selecting the "auto-transform" toggle will teleport the base of the simulated robot to the left controller with a relative offset. With a tool as shown above and changing the offset values manually, you can also co-locate the simulated robot with your actual robot.

#### Execution on the actual robot
You can execute the simulated trajectory on the actual robot by clicking "execute on real robot". At the moment the button is clicked, the joint trajectory will be published to the relevant rostopic, making the actual robot move. You can also execute the current trajectory after redrawing the trajectory. Please be mindful that clicking the button will cause the robot to move immediately.

### Training an ML model

You can train an ML model using your saved trajectories. Clicking the "train a new model" button will open the ML training menu. From the dropdown, you can see the currently implemented ML models. You can also implement the ML model you choose and add it here. To trigger training, click the "start training". The menu will inform you when the training is completed.

</p>
  
#### Testing the trained model

To condition the trained model and generate a new trajectory, enter the "Test Model" menu by clicking the "test trained model" button. Before generating a new trajectory, the start and end points of the desired trajectory should be specified. This is done by placing the virtual cubes at the desired positions with the correct orientations. The blue cube corresponds to the start point, and the green cube the end point. Way-points can be added using the "+/-" buttons in the "Test Model" menu. For each way-point added, the time stamp of all the waypoints is recalculated by evenly dividing the interval with the number of way-points. Also, to exactly specify an orientation regarding orientation indicators in the saved trajectories, (1) the arrow going out of the cube should be in the same direction as the indicator, (2) the side of the virtual cube that has a letter should be in the same direction as of the red side of the indicator. However, these are purely choices of implementations and can be changed easily from the corresponding scripts. After simulation, you can execute the returned trajectory on the actual robot by clicking "execute trajectory on the real robot".
